# Grunt

* If you run into problems running grunt, please make sure that:
  * Node is installed. If not, go to nodejs and download.
  * Once Node is installed, make sure to install grunt-cli globally, like this: npm install -g grunt-cli
  * Then, check if ruby is on your system, typing: ruby -v, if not then install it
  * Last, to compile sass via grunt we need sass installed, for that you need this command:  gem install sass
  * Voila, it should work. Otherwise, just google it!
